Synchronous javascript
======================

Javascript run ONE statement at a time
console.log("one"); 
console.log("two"); 
console.log("three"); 

Async javascript: Governs we perform tasks that takes sometime to complete
(Eg: reading data from a database, reading data from file)
start something now and finish later

Javascript executes code one statement at a time.
statement1;
statement2;
statement3; --> this is to read database (it takes a while)
statement4; because of the third statement, 4th statement is blocked from getting
executed
